# Brainstem

Brainstem is an implementation of [Brainf_ck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) written in SpinalHDL/Scala, targetting FPGAs, specifically the Lattice iCEstick.

Multiple cores can be instantiated within a single system. The iCEstick can fit around 20 cores, last time I checked.

# Status

This was a project to help me learn SpinalSDL and digital logic, and for fun. It will most likely not be maintained further.
